Ambient is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that allows for two-sided AMMs combining concentrated and ambient constant-product liquidity on any arbitrary pair of blockchain assets.  

Ambient runs the entire DEX inside a single smart contract, where individual AMM pools are lightweight data structures instead of separate smart contracts. This and other design decisions makes Ambient the most efficient Ethereum-based DEX in existence.

Ambient Finance raised $6.5M in a Seed funding round led by BlockTower Capital, with participation from Jane Street, Circle Ventures, Tensai Capital, Yunt Capital, Susa Ventures, Quantstamp, Hypotenuse Labs
